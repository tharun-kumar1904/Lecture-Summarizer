About the Project

This project is an Automated Lecture Summarizer that helps students quickly understand long lectures by generating short, meaningful summaries.

It works in four main steps:
Text Processing â€“ Cleans and prepares the text with NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy.
Summarization â€“ Uses pretrained NLP models (like BART or T5) to generate concise summaries of the lecture.

âœ¨ Key Features
Saves time by reducing long lectures into easy-to-read notes.
Provides clear and accurate summaries using modern NLP models.
Simple GUI (Tkinter) for entering or uploading text.
Supports both video/audio input and direct text summarization.

ðŸŽ¯ Goal: To make learning faster and revision easier by helping students focus on the key concepts instead of rewatching or rereading entire lectures.
